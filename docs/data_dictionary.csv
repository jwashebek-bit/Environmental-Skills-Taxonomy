Competency Code,All,"D.SA.N (e.g. 1.1.1). Domains 1–6 are substantive knowledge/practice domains. Domain 7 is the Cross-Cutting Professional Practice domain, housing competencies that apply across multiple domains simultaneously.",Domain.SkillArea.Sequence. Domain 7 skill areas: 7.1 = Professional Ethics Architecture; 7.2 = Human-AI Professional Practice. Code transition note: prior working documents use informal X.1–X.4 notation for ethical competencies; these map to 7.1.1–7.1.4.
